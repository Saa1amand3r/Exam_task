By completing this task, I train my Java skills, including development skills on the Spring framework, as well as working with html, the thymeleaf template engine, and the mysql database. I also practice correct coding and test my coding skills.
At the moment, this project has such functionality as uploading images and then saving them in folder, as well as image data in the database. There is also the functionality of creating a user with his profile picture and other data. As well as the functionality of finding a user by his id in the database.
